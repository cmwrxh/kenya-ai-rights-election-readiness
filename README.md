# Kenya AI Rights & Election Readiness Kit (Feb 5, 2026)

A practical, Kenya-context governance starter pack for teams deploying AI in public-facing or high-trust environments (government, financial services, media, civic tech), with a focus on rights, accountability, and election-adjacent risks.

## What this repo contains
- DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) template + example
- AI risk register (likelihood/impact/controls)
- Model card template + dataset disclosure checklist
- Vendor/procurement AI due diligence checklist
- Red-team prompt pack for misinformation, bias, privacy leaks
- Incident & audit trail templates

## Who it’s for
Engineers, data teams, product managers, compliance, and procurement teams who need “audit-ready” artifacts without heavy bureaucracy.

## Quickstart
1. Start with `templates/dpia.md`
2. Fill `docs/risk-register.csv`
3. Attach evidence in `evidence/`
4. Track decisions in `docs/DECISIONS.md`

## Principles
- Schemas before scripts
- Evidence before confidence
- Controls before launch
